# capture
This scripts allow you to capture commands that are ran from bash and log them to a webserver. The scripts will also poll msfconsole log files to grab commands that were ran inside of msfconsole as well.

Implementation of the webserver is left to the reader.

You should give execution to monitor.py somehow. .bashrc may be a suitable place for you.
